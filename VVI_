Geek and Geekina are running on a running track. They love

meeting each other. Geek can complete a lap in A seconds and

Geekina can complete a lap in B seconds. Both start running at

the same time and both can run atmost for C seconds. Find the

number of times they can meet on the starting point after they

have started running.








class Solution {
    public long meetThem(long A, long B, long C) {
        long lcm = lcm(A, B);
        return C / lcm;
    }

    // Helper function to calculate the least common multiple (LCM)
    private long lcm(long a, long b) {
        return (a * b) / gcd(a, b);
    }

    // Helper function to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD)
    private long gcd(long a, long b) {
        if (b == 0)
            return a;
        return gcd(b, a % b);
    }
